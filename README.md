# Form-Reader
Project to read handwritten text for a standardized form provided by Indiana Limestone


Here is the form we want to read
<img src = "https://github.com/bkhummel/Form-Reader/blob/master/template_matches/0.jpg" width = "500"/>

We use template matching to find the fields and their associated boxes.
To do this, I cropped the titles of each field and used them as templates.
